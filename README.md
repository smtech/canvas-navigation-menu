# Navigation Menu

A global JavaScript add-on to insert additional menus into the main navigation toolbar across the top of the screen. The contents of the menu can be customized in the a MySQL database.

## Caveat Emptor!

At a glance, it looks like [the new Canvas UI that is not-quite-in-beta](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-3949) (ask your CSM to enable it for you) shifts things around a bunch, perhaps obviating this navigation menu add-on. When the beta becomes a little more settled, I'll be taking a look at how to transmogrify this over to the new UI (probably an extra icon on the sidebar, at first guess, with its own slide-out pane, if I can get React to play nice from the Global Javascript). _But I have not yet started even thinking about or looking at how to do this yet!_
